**How to use**

1. Download the zip file
2. Install it in your blender (Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install locate the downloaded Zip and activate)

**How to customize values according to your Projects**

For V0.1.1 I have kept a few default settings that I usually use for my projects but if in case you want to make any changes you can go to your C:\Users\<whichever current user>\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\<whichever blender version>\scripts\addons.
Open it in your text editor/ide of your choice and you can search up what settings value you want to customize. This is a little annoying to setup the first time but for the rest of your project you can use that settings without any need to make changes to those settings

From the image you can see the comments can help you find what you might want to change.
You can save different versions of python files that way you can just disable it and keep multiple versions that have different settings for different projects

This should be a little easier the next release though.

**This is how you use the add-on**
